		<strong>Virgo</strong> is a modern style library to help you build websites and web applications faster, works accross multiple devices, and easier to work with teams.
	</p>
	<p>
		Getting started with Virgo is fairly straighforward.
		We only need to include bundled CSS and JavaScript files in our page.
		In our HTML file, inside head tag, put this line to include the stylesheet:
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-html">
{{ '<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/bundle.min.css">' }}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Then just before closing body tag, put this line to include the script file:
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-html">
{{ '<script type="module" href="/path/to/bundle.min.js"></script>' }}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		That's it, and you are good to go.

	<h4 class="mb-2">Reducing File Size</h4>
	<p>
		You will notice that the bundled CSS file size is large. It is because the vast amount of utility classes available.
		While it doesn't really matter in development, it matters a lot in production environment as it will make the page loading time longer.
		To reduce the file size after development, please read <a href="#">Reducing File Size</a> page.
		Typical sites built with Virgo have under 50 kilobytes CSS file size.

	<h4 class="mb-2">Working with ReactJS, Angular, and Vue</h4>
	<p>
		To build modern web applications, you may use frontend web application frameworks or libraries such as ReactJS, Angular, or Vue.
		Currently, modules for those frameworks are under development. In the meantime, you can use the style library just fine, but not with the components that require JavaScript to work.
