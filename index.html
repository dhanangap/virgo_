			The Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius said in a weekend report to clients that they currently expect
			interest-rate hikes in March, June, September and December and for the central bank to announce the start of a reduction
			in its balance sheet in July.
			
			But they said inflation pressures mean that the “risks are tilted somewhat to the upside of our baseline,” and there is
			a chance officials will act “at every meeting until the inflation picture changes.”
			
			“This raises the possibility of an additional hike or an earlier balance sheet announcement in May, and of more than
			four hikes this year,” the economists said. “We could imagine a number of potential triggers for a shift to rate hikes
			at consecutive meetings.”
