		<h1>Karbala</h1>

		<p>
			<strong>Karbala</strong> or Kerbala is a city in central Iraq, located about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Baghdad, and a few
			miles east of Lake Milh, also known as Razzaza Lake. Karbala is the capital of Karbala Governorate, and has an
			estimated population of 700,000 people (2015).
		</p>

		<p>
			The city, best known as the location of the Battle of Karbala in 680 CE, or the shrines of Imam Husayn and Abbas,
			is considered a holy city for Shia Muslims, in the same way as Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem. Tens of millions of Shi'ite
			Muslims visit the site twice a year, rivaling Mecca and Mashhad by the number of pilgrims annually. The
			martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali is commemorated annually by millions of Shi'ites. Up to 8 million pilgrims
			visit the city to observe ʿĀshūrā (the tenth day of the month of Muharram), which marks the anniversary of Husayn's
			death, but the main event is the Arbaʿīn (the 40th day after 'Ashura'), where up to 30 million visit the graves. Most of
			the pilgrims travel on foot from all around Iraq and more than 56 countries.

		<h2>Etymology</h2>

		<p>
			There are many opinions among different investigators, as to the origin of the word "Karbala". Some have pointed out
			that "Karbala" has a connection to the "Karbalato" language, while others attempt to derive the meaning of word
			"Karbala" by analyzing its spelling and language. They conclude that it originates from the Arabic word "Kar Babel"
			which was a group of ancient Babylonian villages that included Nainawa, Al-Ghadiriyya, Karbella (Karb Illu. as in Arba
			Illu [Arbil]), Al-Nawaweess, and Al-Heer. This last name is today known as Al-Hair and is where Husayn ibn Ali's grave
			is located.
		</p>
		<p>
			The investigator Yaqut al-Hamawi had pointed out that the meaning of "Karbala" could have several explanations, one of
			which is that the place where Husayn ibn Ali was martyred is made of soft earth—"Al-Karbalat".
		</p>
		<p>
			According to Shia's belief, the archangel Gabriel narrated the true meaning of the name Karbalā to Muhammad: a
			combination of karb (Arabic: كَرْب, the land which will cause many agonies) and balā (Arabic: بَلَاء, afflictions)."
		</p>

		<h3>Climate</h3>
		<p>
			Karbala experiences a hot desert climate (BWh in the Köppen climate classification) with extremely hot, long, dry
			summers and mild winters. Almost all of the yearly precipitation is received between November and April, though no month
			is wet.

		<h4>History</h4>

		<h5>Battle of Karbala</h5>

		<p>
			The Battle of Karbala was fought on the bare deserts on the way to Kufa on October 10, 680 (10 Muharram 61 AH). Both
			Husayn ibn Ali and his brother Abbas ibn Ali were buried by the local Banī Asad tribe, at what later became known as the
			Mashhad Al-Husayn. The battle itself occurred as a result of Husain's refusal of Yazid I's demand for allegiance to his
			caliphate. The Kufan governor, Ubaydallah ibn Ziyad, sent thirty thousand horsemen against Husayn as he traveled to
			Kufa. Husayn had no army, he was with his family and few friends who joined them, so there were around 73 men, including
			a 6-month-old Ali Asghar, son of Imam Husayn, in total. The horsemen, under 'Umar ibn Sa'd, were ordered to deny Husayn
			and his followers water in order to force Husayn to agree to give an oath of allegiance. On the 9th of Muharram, Husayn
			refused, and asked to be given the night to pray. On 10 Muharram, Husayn ibn Ali prayed the morning prayer and led his
			troops into battle along with his brother Abbas. Many of Husayn's followers, including all of his present sons Ali
			Akbar, Ali Asghar (six months old) and his nephews Qassim, Aun and Muhammad were killed.
		</p>

		<p>
			In 63 AH (682 CE), Yazid ibn Mu'awiya released the surviving members of Husayn's family from prison as there was a threat
			of uprisings and some of the people in his court were unaware of who the battle was with, when they got to know that the
			descendants of Muhammad were killed, they were horrified . On their way to Mecca, they stopped at the site of the
			battle. There is record of Sulayman ibn Surad going on pilgrimage to the site as early as 65 AH (685 CE). The city began
			as a tomb and shrine to Husayn and grew as a city in order to meet the needs of pilgrims. The city and tombs were
			greatly expanded by successive Muslim rulers, but suffered repeated destruction from attacking armies. The original
			shrine was destroyed by the Abbasid Caliph Al-Mutawakkil in 850 but was rebuilt in its present form around 979, only to
			be partly destroyed by fire in 1086 and rebuilt yet again.

		<h6>University</h6>

		<p>
			Hawza are the Islamic education institutions that are run collectively by mujtahid or Allamas to teach Shia Muslims and
			guide them through the rigorous journey of becoming and Alim. In terms of the hawaz in Karbala, After the death of a
			renowned Alama, the Sayyid Muhammad, the leadership in terms of teacher shifted to taqlid to mujtahid. This was a
			significant factor that lead to the leadership of Ulama to reside in Karbala and as well as Najaf. Initially Karbala's
			hawza (Islamic education institution) consisted mostly of Iranians and Turkish Ulama. After the death of Sharif-ul-Ulama
			Mazandarani in 1830 and the repression of the shia population by the Ottomans in 1843 both played an important role in
			the relocation of many Ulamas and thus Najaf becoming the center of Shia Islamic leadership in education.
